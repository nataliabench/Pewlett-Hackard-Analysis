# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Every company and major corporation faces the same issue when addressing retirement plans for their employees.  When an employee reaches a certain age and begins thinking about retiring, the company must take this into account to determine the amount of employees leaving each year and how many positions are going to be needed to be filled due to retiring employees.  Pewlett Hackard is currently dealing with this issue and has asked us to assist on evaluating analysis  to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in their mentorship program. We will build an employee database for PH with the use of SQL and our data modeling, enginerring, and analysis skills.

## Results
Our calculations show that out of the total 300,024 employees at Pewlett Hackard, **90,398 (30.13%) employees will likely retire soon**.  In terms of those 90,398 employees likely to retire soon, **the majority hold positions as Senior Engineers (32.53%) and Senior Staff (31.25%) employees.  The fewest retiring soon are Managers**.

As for those retiring soon by department, the **majority of them work in the Development Department**, followed by Production, Sales, Customer Service, Research, Quality Management, Marketing, Human Resources and Finance Departments.

Finally, our analysis evaluated that a **total of 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.**

## Summary
Although these calculated predictions on the amount of employees possibly retiring, Packard Hackard must still wait to determine the actual amount of roles that are going to be needed to be filled when those possibly retiring make their decision.  But based on our analysis, about 90,398 employees will most likely decide to retire soon.
